\section{Introduction}

Fu-Type YAVBWC (Yet another version, but with cards) is a side scrolling 2D action bullet hell shooter with a unique card-power-up mechanic, aimed at casual to hardcore gamers.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Description}

You start of with a basic ship and nothing else but to play your first level. After finishing the first semi-boss you receive a card which represents a power-up that will automatically be equipped to the first of your three passive power-up slots. After a few more waves of basic enemies, which are now considerably easier then before the difficulty cranks up and you soon find another semi-boss from whom you receive an active power-up. After finishing the final boss for this tutorial level you get five more passive and another active power-up.

All power-ups (more firepower, an additional weapon or different ships) are represented by cards. There are several card tiers, meaning for example a 'rare'  health-up card is stronger as a 'common' one. Also there are different ways to unlock them, like just by completing a stage for a basic card or things like beating a set highscore, doing challenge or even a hidden challenge to unlock higher tiered cards.

To finish the game you'll need nothing more then the basic set, so the casual gamer is not alienated by grinding for cards. But gamers hunting for a highscore will have work to do, getting their cards, as well as putting together an optimal deck (which should differ by level as well as playstyle).

An additional gamemode where you play the game from beginning to end in a rogue-like fashion, just being able to use the cards that drop randomly for you in this run. Players might and should be able to break the game completely when they get good cards, but also the game should be crushingly hard if they get unlucky drops.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Key features}

Simple but deep mechanic: Everything is as card, but how to mix and match them to get the optimal synergy is not easy.

Different Gamemodes make for a totaly different experience: Just playing the game for the casual gamer, optimizing the deck and going for a new highscore for the hardcore gamer, having a gamble and trying the rogue-like mode for another round.

\section{Platform(s)}

Since almost all modern platforms can handle a 2D game even with a high visual fidelity there is no limit to on what platform this game can be released.
